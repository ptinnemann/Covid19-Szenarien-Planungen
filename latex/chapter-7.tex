Narrative: Further variants emerge but there is no major antigenic evolution, gains in transmissibility or a return to Delta-level intrinsic severity. Minimal further escape from current vaccines and infection-induced immunity. Minor seasonal/regional outbreaks from waning immunity and minor antigenic change. Existing vaccines used annually to boost vulnerable only. Antivirals have a significant impact on mortality and morbidity and remain effective. Years with higher SARS-CoV-2 waves tend to have fewer influenza cases. In the next 12-18 months: Relatively small resurgence in Autumn/Winter 2022/23 with low levels of severe disease.
