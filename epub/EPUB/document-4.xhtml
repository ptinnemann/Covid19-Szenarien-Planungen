      <p>Narrative: High global incidence along with increasing population immunity drives unpredictable emergence of variants for many years, with a combination of enhanced immune evasion and greater transmissibility relative to Omicron, sometimes more than once per year and/or with intrinsic severity similar to Delta in bad years. Existing immunity and updated vaccines continue to provide good protection against most severe outcomes. Although no more severe, repeated waves of infection cause widespread disruption with disproportionate impacts in some groups, e.g. children in education. Widespread annual vaccination with updated vaccines. Anti-viral resistance is widespread. SARS-CoV-2 waves do not reduce influenza; SARS-CoV-2 waves overlap leading to further burdens on healthcare. Limited voluntary protective behaviours during waves. Some countries impose more significant NPIs in bad years. In the next 12-18 months: Emergence of a new variant of concern results in a large wave of infections, potentially at short notice and out of Autumn/Winter. However, severe disease and mortality remain concentrated in certain groups (and lower than pre-vaccination), e.g. unvaccinated, vulnerable and elderly.</p>
